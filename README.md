# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This homework consisted of creating and coding a portfolio using my current knowledge of html and css documents.

At the top of the page consist of my name, a background image, an avatar photo, and hyperlinks related to the page.
I have hyperlinked "About Me", "Previous Work", "Contact Me", and "Resume" to take you to each corresponding section of the page. 
Inside each of each of those containers contain links which direct you to a new webpage with information correlated to each individual container. 

I have added links for each reader/employer to be able to contact me directly vie email and phone number.

At the very bottom of the page contains who the webpage was created by.

I will be re-submitting this in the future as I kept running into problems and didn't have enough time to fix them......
